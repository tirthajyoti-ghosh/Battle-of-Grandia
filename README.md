<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![The Battle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57726348/89709306-4856e000-d99c-11ea-8972-e02dd8df2c9b.png)

This is a very simple RPG game where a warrior goes about his day exploring the world and adventuring and doing all other warrior/hero stuff and will seldom cross path with a fiery Kraken that throws fireballs on all sides. As a player, you will help our warrior here with defeating the Kraken whenever he comes across one.

In your adventure, you will come acroos several of these fiery krakens that dotted the map. Once you defeat a Kraken, you earn points and are allowed to move with your life as an adventurer. You accumulate these points as you move forward defeating krakens after krakens. But once a Kraken manages to kill you, you will end up where every JS object ends up after getting `destroy` ed - the void. You will cease to exist and you will lose all your points.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Instructions

You will start your adventure with an

* Welcome screen where you will put your name (so other players recognize you when they see your top scores!), then

* You will be presented with four choices:
  * Start playing the game, or
  * Turn on/off the music, or
  * A chance for you to be thankful for this game, or
  * See where you stand in the Leaderboard.

* Once you choose to start playing the game, you will be dropped in a beautiful and scenic world that you could only dream about. You can choose to explore or you can choose to engage with a Kraken. Mind you, the krakens will look small, but it's their disguise. When you engage,

* You will be transported to their world where you have to battle the Kraken -

  * You can move your character by `W` - forward, `A` - left, `S` - backward, `D`- right.
  * **IMPORTANT!** As you have a sword, however powerful it may be, it's a melee weapon. So you have to be very close to the Kraken to make any damage. When you are very close to the Kraken,
  * Press `SPACE` key to attack it, and
  * Remember to not get hit by its fireballs.
  
This game sure sounds simple but it's not. Give it a try.
